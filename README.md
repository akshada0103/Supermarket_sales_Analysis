The retail manager of the supermarket store wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase their products and their purchasing behavior within the region, to do so we need to analyze the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors'. The insights from the analysis will feed into the supermarket's strategic plan in the next half year. We need to examine transaction data, examine customer data, look for the total sales, drivers of sales, find out from where the highest sales are coming from and determine which segment should be targeted
